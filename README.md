# About

As its name suggests, it is a faux Jappa (i.e. 1.14+ new materials) texture pack that requires [Modernity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/modernity) as a front.

Another classic texture pack is built in [Jappafied Modded](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/jappafied-modded), which has strong mod compatibility and supports most major mods.

Maybe you still don't understand what we are doing? Then let's take an example(see Gallery).

You can also read the wiki, he certainly speaks better than I do.

The original textures were created by Modernity, this resource pack is a Mod extension to Modernity.
Of course this material is not just the simplest ingots ported, but tries to replicate the high version exactly.

Remember to put the pack mapping as priority above Modernity.

Proof that I have the permission to include Jappafied Modded in my resource pack.

Most of the texture are not mine, so you will need to check up the changelog from the last updates to know the owner and credit him/her. The texture I drew is MIT License, you can use them just like you want.
